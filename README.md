# Okamoto (2006) Blind Signatures
## Efficient Blind and Partially Blind Signatures Without Random Oracles

Implementations of blind and partially blind signatures over elliptic curves as described in [Efficient Blind and Partially Blind Signatures Without Random Oracles](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11681878_5.pdf).

This library provides a usable implementation of the algorithm without regard to its eventual use. Uses such as in a "mint", are left to the implementor.

The key innovation of the paper and therefore of this library is in permitting *partially* blind signatures where the signer and the user share some component of the message (potentially the null string) openly. This would make it useful, for example, in a mint application where the mint (bank) executes out-of-band logic to verify the user's balance before signing an ATM-like withdrawal of an agreed denomination.

# Features

* `bls12_381_plain` (default): Plain implementation over the [BLS12-128](http://docs.rs/bls12_381) elliptic curve secure against constant-depth concurrent adversaries (not secure against fully concurrent adversaries).
